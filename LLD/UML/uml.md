# UML
UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a standardized visual modeling language used in software engineering to design, visualize, and document software systems. It provides a set of graphical notations to represent different aspects of a system including structure, behavior, and interactions between components.

## Key Benefits
- **Standardization**: Common language for developers and stakeholders
- **Visualization**: Clear representation of complex system architecture
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive system documentation
- **Communication**: Bridge between technical and non-technical team members

## Common UML Diagrams
- **Structural Diagrams**: Class, Object, Component, Deployment
- **Behavioral Diagrams**: Use Case, Activity, Sequence, State Machine
