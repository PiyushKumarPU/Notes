# Structural Design Patterns ðŸ§±

## ðŸ”¹ What are they?

Structural patterns are about **how classes and objects are composed together** to form larger structures, while keeping them **flexible and efficient**.

They focus on the **relationship between entities** rather than object creation.

## ðŸ”¹ Types of Structural Patterns

1. [**Adapter**](./Adapter.md) â†’ Converts one interface into another (bridge between incompatible systems).
2. [**Bridge**](./Bridge.md) â†’ Decouples abstraction from implementation so they can vary independently.
3. [**Composite**](./Composite.md) â†’ Treats individual objects and groups of objects uniformly.
4. [**Decorator**](./Decorator.md) â†’ Dynamically adds behavior to objects without modifying the class.
5. [**Facade**](./Facade.md) â†’ Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
6. [**Flyweight**](./Flyweight.md) â†’ Reduces memory usage by sharing common state.
7. [**Proxy**](./Proxy.md) â†’ Provides a substitute or placeholder for another object to control access.
8. [**Summary**](./Summary.md)  â†’ Summary for Structural design pattern
