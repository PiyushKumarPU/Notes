### What is a Design Pattern?

A **design pattern** is a reusable solution to a common software design problem. It’s not a ready-made piece of code but a **general blueprint** that can be adapted to fit different contexts.

Unlike algorithms (which define exact steps), patterns are high-level concepts. Think of an algorithm as a *recipe* and a design pattern as a *blueprint*—the blueprint shows the structure and intent, but the implementation details are up to you.

### What does a Pattern Consist of?

A typical design pattern description includes:

* **Intent** – the problem and the solution it addresses.
* **Motivation** – why the pattern is useful.
* **Structure** – class relationships and roles.
* **Code Example** – practical demonstration.
* (Optional) **Applicability, implementation steps, and relations with other patterns**.
