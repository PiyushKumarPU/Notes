 * Basic Singleton with no thread safety
 *
 * A Singleton ensures that only one instance of a class exists
 * throughout the application and provides a global access point to it.
 *
 * This implementation is the simplest form of Singleton in Java.
 * However, it is **NOT THREAD-SAFE**, meaning multiple threads calling
 * getInstance() at the same time may create multiple instances.
